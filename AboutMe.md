<p> Hello again! My name is Leticia Magalhaes and I am a dual bachelor's in Physics and Optoelectronics Engineering, as well as an Applied Physics masterâ€™s student at the State University of Campinas. I am currently researching means to design light-sound interactions via hybrid material interfaces in optical cavities.  I have experience with optical forces, Brillouin scattering, and photonic design. My research focuses on investigating how light interacts with sound and its surrounding media, aiming to pave the way for the solution of milestones within the photonics industry. Additionally, I am absolutely passionate about optics and photonic design, since I see optical technologies as a playground of opportunities for re-inventing the technological setting, pushing the boundaries between reality and science fiction. On that note, I also believe science to be an incubator to the future of society and am devoted to diversity initiatives that can help make science, specifically STEM, more democratic. </p>
