<h1>Photonics Webinar Series </h1>
<p>Mengjie is a 2020 OSA Ambassador and I met her online during OSA events. Her research is outstanding, and I personally find it really interesting. Our student chapter at Unicamp doing a series of webinars on hot topics in optics and photonics, the "Photonics Webinar Series." Precisely because of our vision, when I met Mengjie, she felt like the perfect speaker to debut this series.<br><br>She accepted our invitation and our chapter was honored to have her.</p>

<h1 style="margin-left: 20px; text-align: left;"> Chat with Niahm Kavanagh </h1>
<p>I met Niahm at the 2020 Student Leadership conference. I immediately related to her experiences as a woman in STEM and shared many point of views about navigating this evironment. I felt like just talking to her gave me so much insight and perspective that I wanted others in my institute to feel the same way. So I approached a member of the Unicamp Physics Institute Graduate Students Union (APGF) and asked about organizing an informal conversation about diversity and inclusion with Niahm.</p>

<p>Finally, the OSA student chapter and APGF collaborated to organize this event, which I am very thankful for happening.</p>
