<h1>Photonics Webinar Series</h1>
<p>Mengjie is a 2020 OSA Ambassador and I het her online during OSA events. Her research is outstanding, and I personally find it really interesting. Our student chapter at Unicamp had discussed about doing a series of webinars about hot topics in optics and photonics, the "Photonics Webinar Series." Precisely beacause of our vision, when I met Mengjie, she felt like the perfect speaker to debut this series.</p>

<p> She accepted our invitation and our chapter was honored to have her. </p>
