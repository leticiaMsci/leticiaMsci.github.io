<h1>Photonics Webinar Series</h1>

<p>Mengjie is a 2020 OSA Ambassador and I het her online during OSA events. Her research is outstanding, and I personally find it really interesting. Our student chapter at Unicamp had discussed about doing a series of webinars about hot topics in optics and photonics, the "Photonics Webinar Series." Precisely beacause of our vision, when I met Mengjie, she felt like the perfect speaker to debut this series.</p>

<p> She accepted our invitation and our chapter was honored to have her. </p>

<h1>Chat with Niahm Kavanagh</h1>
<p>I met Niahm at the 2020 Student Leadership conference. I immediately related to her experiences as a woman in STEM and shared many point of views about navigating this evironment. I felt like just talking to her gave me so much insight and perspective that I wanted others in my institute to feel the same way. So I approached a member of the Unicamp Physics Institute Graduate Students Union (APGF) and asked about organizing an informal conversation about diversity and inclusion with Niahm. </p>

<p> Finally, the OSA student chapter and APGF collaborated to organize this event, which I am very thankful for happening. </p>
