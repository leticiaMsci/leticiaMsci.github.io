<h1>Presentations</h1>
Here are some interesting presentations I did in the past year.
<ol>
<li><p> <b>"1D Weak-form solution of elastic wave equations in onion-like systems" 
 (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D7fE_lGH47Q02TlPv0cQA6BKaFdV_qgyC5zr5-mqHyc/edit?usp=sharing"> link to presentation</a>)</b></p>
 <p>I presented this to my master's research group (LPD at UNICAMP, Brazil), discussing a numeric strategy to solve the elastic wave equation in spherical systems. I show that you can use a convenient ansatz to separate the solution's radial dependence and reduce the problem to a 1D domain (radial coordinate). This proved to be a paramount strategy to obtain acoustic modes in the whispering-gallery regime.<p></li>


<li><p> <b>"Tarantula-Inspired Noniridescent Photonics with Long-Range Order"</p>
(<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AUnUDuvDBSN_g6OFbsxFahFdBEr2ANEm5IaHp-pYffs/edit?usp=sharing">link to presentation </a>)</b> 
 <p>This was a seminar I presented for my Material Science class, based on a scientific paper. The idea was to discuss the demonstration of noniridescent structural color by a design inspired on the nanostructures present on blue tarantula's hairs.</p></li>
